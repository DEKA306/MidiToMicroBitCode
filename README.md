# MidiToMicroBitCode
This Python script should be in the same path as the midi file you want to convert,and you need to save it as qqq.mid. You also need to create a midi file so that only one sound plays at the same time. And when you run it, it's copied right away. Just paste the copied text into the python part of the microbit code editor.
